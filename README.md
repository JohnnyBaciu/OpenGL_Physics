# OpenGL_Physics<br/>
### A project focused on creating physical simulations using OpenGl in C++



here is a link to some dependencies: 
**https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_BV8G4HLCHzJc6U-cAqmA_74Zak0Pfhv?usp=drive_link**
For easy testing with windows OS. Platform compatibility changes soon to come. 

<br/>
The goal in mind with this project is to create a series of physical simulations, working up to cooler things. Beginning with 2D ball collision and working up, and beyond, simulating celestial bodies using general relativity. 

<br/><br/>
The whole project is made for Windows but feel free to try for linux or mac. Efforts will be made to clean up Makefile to work for all platforms.

Help is from anyone is appreciated
